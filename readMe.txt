Follow these steps to setup the translator

1. Add +con_logfile "file_name_here" to CSGO launch options

*NOTES*
To be fixed:
    a random crash happens after every first setup

Fixed:
    Every message is now sent only once because it 
    makes more sense. 
    Messages are only updated once per second and
    log file is cleared every time that's done
